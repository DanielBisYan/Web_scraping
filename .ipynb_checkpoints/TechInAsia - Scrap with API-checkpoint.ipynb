That’s the market that <a href=\"https://www.ayannah.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ayannah</a> has been serving with its stack of digital financial services.</p>\\n<p>Backed by venture capital firms like 500 Startups and Wavemaker Partners, the startup created a software-as-as-service platform hosting payment agents across the Philippines that can cash out remittances for families.</p>\\n<p>“The cost of sending money to the countryside used to be as high as 7% of the principal amount. But with more cash-out centers, the rates have gone down to 3% today,” Ayannah founder Mikko Perez tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\\n<p>Connecting agents has made cash-outs easier, too. Banks and traditional money transfer outlets are few and far between in rural areas, so recipients often have to travel hours to redeem their money.</p>\\n<p>What Ayannah does is convert brick-and-mortar businesses like courier branches, pawnshops, pharmacies, and gas stations into cash-out agents, placing them along with established remittance players in one “interoperable” network. What this means is that money can be sent and received through any of the agents in the network. An app version also allows any mom-and-pop shop or individual with a smartphone to become an agent.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633650\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633650\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633650\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ayannah-sari-sari-store.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633650\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A village store offers financial services for Ayannah partner Panalo Express / Photo credit: Ayannah</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Ayannah’s platform doesn’t stop with remittances. There are other services like mobile top-ups, bill payments, and e-wallet cash-ins.</p>\\n<p>The idea is to make agents so ubiquitous that consumers can perform transactions from wherever they are.</p>\\n<h2>Gaining serious traction</h2>\\n<p>When <em>Tech in Asia</em> <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ayannah-philippines-remittance-payment-service-gree-ventures-funding\">last caught up</a> with Ayannah five years ago, it was still laying the groundwork for the business, seeing a few transactions here and there.</p>\\n<p>Today, with close to 10,000 agents serving 12 million consumers, transactions have gone up to more than 50,000 per day, Perez says. That gives Ayannah – which takes a percentage fee, the same as its agents – a steady revenue stream.</p>\\n<p>The company grew its revenue 12-fold between 2016 and 2019, and expects to become profitable by 2021 as new services give it a boost.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-633654\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ayannah-chart.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"822\"></p>\\n<p>Ayannah has been collecting transactional data, which it’s now using to assess the creditworthiness of unbanked but “economically active” consumers, according to Perez.</p>\\n<p>Whereas other credit-scoring startups like Lenddo and Trusting Social analyze social media and telecom data, Ayannah claims to be the first to use actual financial data. The company has inked an exclusive agreement to use the data of the Philippines’ largest bill payments chain to complement its own.</p>\\n<p>Ayannah’s AI scoring system identifies new customers for financial institutions looking to offer products such as microinsurance and loans.</p>\\n<p>Global insurers such as Axa and several traditional and online lenders have come on board as partners. Ayannah has also roped in Malaysian banking giant CIMB, which earlier this year established its presence in the Philippines as <a href=\"https://businessmirror.com.ph/2019/01/30/__trashed-6/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the nation’s first all-digital bank</a>.</p>\\n<p>“CIMB has no branches and ATMs, so an option for them is to use our network of agents to disburse loans and collect repayments,” Neil Palteng, senior product manager at Ayannah, tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\\n<p>The startup has just rolled out a separate online marketplace called KayaCredit – similar to iMoney and eCompareMo – where consumers can apply and get approved for loans.</p>\\n<p>“But unlike our competitors, we’re an ecosystem. We provide our partners a complete solution, from credit scoring and lead generation to disbursement and payment collection via our agent network,” points out Palteng.</p>\\n<h2>Cash is still king</h2>\\n<p>The ultimate goal, Perez says, is to “build the largest interoperable agent-based network for delivering digital financial services across all channels – over the web, over the mobile phone, and over the counter – in the Philippines.”</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633649\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633649\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633649\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/mikko-perez-ayannah.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"422\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633649\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mikko Perez speaking at The Economist Finance Disrupted Conference / Photo credit: Ayannah</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Using agents to facilitate transactions seems counterintuitive, especially with the aggressive promotions of regional e-wallets like GrabPay and local ones like Alibaba-backed GCash and Tencent-backed PayMaya, which consumers can use to transact on their own. But Perez believes the cashless concept has a long way to go in the Philippines, so there’s a tremendous opportunity that his company can capture right now.</p>\\n<p>While e-wallets have started to see some traction, he says cash still accounts for 99% of transactions in the country and the majority of Filipino consumers still prefer this payment method.</p>\\n<p>Among the reasons why he thinks agents are still the best way to reach consumers are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Mobile internet is just becoming available, especially in rural areas, which means people have yet to try e-wallets. Internet speed and stability also remain a challenge, so it’s hard to create the habit of paying via e-wallets</li>\\n<li>Many merchants don’t accept electronic payments yet. It’s still more convenient to carry cash</li>\\n<li>People in rural – and to some extent, urban – areas have low disposable income, so they don’t have enough money to store in e-wallets</li>\\n<li>E-wallet cash-in options are still limited</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Ayannah faces off against Bangkok-based TrueMoney, which also makes use of a network of agents – mostly mom-and-pop shops – to deliver financial services in the Philippines. Owned by Alibaba-backed Ascend Group, TrueMoney has more than 20,000 agent centers in the Philippines and a total of 65,000 across Southeast Asia.</p>\\n<h2>Preparing for the future</h2>\\n<p>While Ayannah is keeping a close eye on its rival, Perez is confident that the market is big enough for more than one player to exist and says that his company’s offerings are more diversified.</p>\\n<p>In fact, Ayannah is about to roll out what it calls a “SuperPOS” – an omni point-of-sale device that allows agents and merchants to process:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>mobile top-ups</li>\\n<li>e-wallet cash-ins/outs</li>\\n<li>domestic remittances</li>\\n<li>bills payments</li>\\n<li>insurance premium payments</li>\\n<li>loan disbursement and repayments</li>\\n<li>cash, card, and QR code payments</li>\\n<li>cash deposit and withdrawals</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>“So far this is the only device in the Philippines that can do all of these functions,” says Perez. “This allows us to cater to both banked and unbanked, and process cash and non-cash payment methods, which means we’re able to take advantage of the opportunity today and prepare for the future.”</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633651\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633651\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633651\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ayannah-superpos.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633651\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The ‘SuperPOS’ / Photo credit: Ayannah</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>It’s uncertain how much demand there is for the POS device, given that other players like PayMaya have launched their own devices rivaling Ayannah in this arena.</p>\\n<p>However, Perez says the cash withdrawal functionality is most handy because there aren’t enough ATMs across the Philippines – just as few as 29 per 100,000 adults. At the same time, it allows merchants to disburse their cash at a profit, when previously they’d have to pay armored car services to bring the cash to the bank.</p>\\n<p>“And the SuperPOS is just a fraction of the cost of an ATM machine,” he notes.</p>\\n<h2>Making an impact</h2>\\n<p>Perez has always wanted to make a difference in people’s lives. After his university days, Perez did volunteer development work for a few years before joining his family’s agriculture business. He eventually left the Philippines to pursue a masters degree at Harvard Business School and a career in investment banking at JPMorgan Chase in the US.</p>\\n<p>When he came back, he served as director at instant messaging app Chikka, which he helped steer to profitability before it was sold to one of the Philippines’ telco duopoly.</p>\\n<p>He used part of the money he earned from the sale to set up Ayannah.</p>\\n<p>“Things have come full circle for me,” he says. “I’m back to where I started. I hope to bring my experience in finance and technology to help build better communities.”</p>\\n<p>Ayannah is keen to adapt to other emerging Southeast Asian markets like Vietnam and Indonesia, which also have huge unbanked populations. The company has already started operations in Indonesia and will enter Vietnam in 2020.</p>\\n<p>To bankroll its expansion plans, Ayannah is targeting to close its series B round early next year. It has raised US$8 million to date.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>Dear Readers,</p>\\n<p>These days in tech, profitable startups are looking very sexy, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/the-positive-impact-of-adam-neumann\">WeWork, Adam Neumann, and SoftBank</a>. 😘 But to people outside of the tech and startup community, it must have been so amusing to see that most industry insiders are only now starting to realize that turning a profit is critical to the survival of any business.</p>\\n<p>Becoming a unicorn doesn’t really mean anything anymore. We know that all too well at <em>Tech in Asia</em>: Whenever the subject or headline says “unicorn xyz,” for example, the click rate isn’t as high as we’d hoped. I think it’s a sign that readers are sick of the term, too.</p>\\n<p>So instead of “unicorn,” folks are coming up with different terms to more accurately differentiate companies with high valuation from businesses that have a healthy P&amp;L. The most recent one that has been circulating is “rhinoceros.” 🦏 As Nick Nash, co-founder and managing partner of Asia Partners, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/asia-partners-looks-rhinos\">puts it</a>: “It’s got a horn, but it is worth US$1 billion in a P/E [price-to-earnings] multiple, not on a revenue multiple.”</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633399\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633399\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633399\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/rhino.jpg\" alt=\"rhino\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1078\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633399\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@gerandeklerk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Geran de Klerk </a>/Unsplash</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>In our quick chats with founders, I learned that startups big and small are taking steps towards being profitable. To me, that’s a good indication that the community is becoming wiser and more responsible. And for companies, perhaps it’s also an exercise in managing scale – being or staying lean and mean ahead of an impending global financial downturn is probably a smart move.</p>\\n<p>At <em>Tech in Asia</em>, we always make sure to ask founders if the business is profitable. Here’s a list of companies we covered in 2019 that were in the black at the time of our coverage:</p>\\n<p><strong>Wego</strong> – The online travel search and booking platform became profitable over a year ago, and hit a milestone of US$1 billion bookings in 2018. <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/wego-survive-14-years\">Read more</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>M-DAQ</strong> – In 2018, it hit full-year profitability for the first time.

       "   'content': '<p>In 2018, three years after entrepreneur Lal Chand Bisu sold his edtech startup Easyprep to Mumbai-based exam preparation platform Toppr for an undisclosed amount of money, he got hooked on listening to audiobooks and podcasts.</p>\\n<p>That was also the time when Bisu was looking for ideas for a new startup, as he had been working as Toppr’s lead engineer since 2015.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_626962\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-626962\" class=\"size-full wp-image-626962\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/microphone-2618102_1280.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-626962\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: StockSnap</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>He, along with two other colleagues – now his co-founders – decided to test their theory regarding how serious people in India were when it came to podcasts. They ran a survey and found out that not only were people looking for new podcast channels, they were also ready to pay for exclusive content available in vernacular language.</p>\\n<p>“Once we realized that a podcast channel in regional language could be a game-changer, since there weren’t many players in this space, we jumped right in,” Bisu, co-founder and CEO at Kuku FM, told <em>KrAsia</em>.</p>\\n<p>To get started, Bisu, together with Vinod Meena and Vikas Goyal, put in their own money and began developing a new podcast app. After only three months, it was ready for beta testing.</p>\\n<p>“When we checked our user engagement rate in September 2018 and found that users were listening to our audiobooks for 40 minutes per day, that excited us, and we started approaching investors,” Bisu said.</p>\\n<p>The company managed to raise a small pre-seed round of funding by the end of 2018, allowing them to run for 12 months. The firm then raised an undisclosed amount of seed funding earlier this month from 3One4 Capital, Shunwei Capital, and India Quotient. The cash will be used to expand its content library and user base, Bisu said.</p>\\n<p>He said people are now willing to consume content such as poetry, investigative stories, mythological stories, and game shows in audio format, making podcast distribution platform appealing to users in India.</p>\\n<h2><strong>Targeting mature users</strong></h2>\\n<p>Unlike other internet-based entertainment companies that are going after first-time internet users in smaller cities, Kuku FM believes targeting such users will take a longer time to monetize, so it’s specifically going after professionals, students, and retirees who are looking for quality content.</p>\\n<p>“First-time users come on to the internet for instant gratification and mostly use services like TikTok and YouTube, and are not willing to pay for content,” Bisu said.</p>\\n<p>Currently, around 85% of Kuku FM users are from India’s tier one and two cities. Bisu said that after a while, when first-time users realize they are wasting their time and will start looking for meaningful content, his company will target them as well.</p>\\n<p>“Podcast users are busy professionals who want meaningful content in their life and choose podcasts because it’s not as intrusive or as time-consuming as books. Plus, we can add rich content in podcasts to make the experience better than reading books,” he added.</p>\\n<p>Kuku FM has been partnering with publishers to gain intellectual property rights and create audio content from popular published books. He did not reveal the names of publishers that the company is in talks with due to competitive reasons. However, the platform features books such as <em>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</em>, <em>The Secret</em>, and the Bhagwat Gita in audio format.</p>\\n<p>The company has an eye on monetization and that is one reason why it’s going after the demography that already spends money online. “People who have already subscribed to platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, and YouTube will have no problem paying for exclusive content on our platform when we start monetizing,” Bisu said.</p>\\n<p>The content on its platform is a mix of audiobooks, poems, news, jokes, standalone ghost stories, mythology, and more. Bisu claimed the platform has over 2,100 podcasts and that around 1 million users have accessed it. He also said that, on average, people spend around 50 minutes a day on Kuku FM, on its app, as well as on the website, listening to and browsing different podcasts.</p>\\n<p>Kuku FM also allows users to generate their own content on the app, which Bisu claimed has an “advanced audio-editing tool that can cut 90% of the noise, change voice tempo, and add background music to give a professional feel to the user-generated content.”</p>\\n<p>Currently, there are around 800 users who create and upload their own podcasts onto the platform in various genres. On top of that, Kuku FM works with around 200 professional radio jockeys who create podcasts out of novels and short stories that the company acquires from publishers.</p>\\n<p>“The plan is to create a substantial number of podcasts that are exclusive to us before we start monetizing these audiobooks,” Bisu said. He is looking at 2021 as the year when the company will actively monetize its content. It will even add new categories such as audio tutorials for generating revenue.</p>\\n<p>At the moment, content on Kuku FM is only available in Hindi. The startup will use its recent funding to add two more languages to its platform in the next six months. “Hindi is still a pretty big market to capture, considering there are a few other players, such as Khabri and Headfone, doing exactly what we are doing,” he said.</p>\\n<p>While Bengaluru-based Headfone raised US$750,000 from Fosun RZ Capital in a seed round in July, Khabri was chosen for Y Combinator’s summer batch this year. Apart from these firms, self-publishing platform Pratilipi is also entering the podcast and audiobook market after raising US$14 million from Qiming Ventures this year.</p>\\n<p>Bisu will compete with all these companies that want a share of users’ time.</p>\\n<p><em>This report was first published on</em> <a href=\"https://kr-asia.com/kuku-fm-will-get-you-hooked-on-podcasts-and-audiobooks-startup-stories\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">KrAsia</a>.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>Earlier waves of automation may have already taken the most repetitive jobs from the hands of factory workers, but the AI revolution is likely to affect better-educated and better-paid white-collar workers – many of them men – the most, according to a study released on Wednesday.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_369162\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-369162\" class=\"wp-image-369162 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/33618149_l.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2507\" height=\"1673\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-369162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.123rf.com/profile_pressmaster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pressmaster / 123RF</a></p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Brookings Institution researchers overlaid keywords in AI-related patents with job descriptions listed in the US government’s official occupational database to measure each job’s varying levels of “exposure” to AI applications in the near future.</p>\\n<p>The findings showed that AI could affect work in virtually every occupational group. A previous analysis by Stanford University doctoral candidate Michael Webb, who developed the technique used in the Brookings researchers’ study, found that 740 out of 769 occupational descriptions analyzed contained one or more of tasks that could potentially be exposed to, complemented by or completed by AI.</p>\\n<p>While research on automation’s robotics and software continues to show that less educated, lower-wage workers may be most vulnerable to displacement, the Washington-based institute’s latest analysis showed that AI will be a significant factor in the future work lives of relatively well-paid managers, supervisors, and analysts.</p>\\n<p>Bachelor’s degree holders were the most exposed to AI by education level, more than five times as much as workers with just a high school degree, while those with graduate or professional degrees were four times more exposed than high school degree holders.</p>\\n<p>“Unlike robotics (associated with the factory floor) and computers (associated with routine office activities), AI has a distinctly white-collar bent,” the researchers said in the report.</p>\\n<p>“While earlier waves of automation have led to disruption across the lower half of the wage distribution, AI appears likely to have different impacts, with its own windfalls and challenges. White-collar, well-paid America – radiologists, legal professionals, optometrists, and many more – will likely get no free pass on this flavor of digital disruption.”</p>\\n<p>Skilled factory workers, who are increasingly well-educated in many occupations as well as heavily involved with AI on the shop floor, were also among the groups found to be more exposed to the influence of AI. This may be much less of a factor in the work of lower-paid service workers such as dental assistants and cooks, the researchers said.</p>\\n<p>Men, overrepresented in both analytical, technical, and professional roles as well as production, were found to work in occupations with much higher AI exposure scores. Meanwhile, the report said that women’s heavy involvement in “interpersonal” occupations in education, healthcare support, and personal care services appeared to shelter them from the impact of AI development.</p>\\n<p>Notably, the analysis predicted areas of work in which some kind of impact is expected but not specifically whether AI will substitute existing work, complement it, or create entirely new work for humans.</p>\\n<p><em>Visit\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SCMP.com</a>\\xa0for the latest China tech news.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Copyright (c) 2019.

       "   'content': '<p>Back in March 2016, an AI program developed by Google made headlines when it bested world Go champ Lee Se-dol in what has been called humanity’s most complex game.</p>\\n<p>What few know is that to achieve the decisive victory, the AlphaGo program had to be powered by nearly 2,000 central processing units (CPUs) and 300 graphics processing units (GPUs). The electricity bills were as high as US$3,000 a game at the time, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor Han Song said in a recent speech at Tsinghua University.</p>\\n<p>In the same month as AlphaGo’s victory over South Korean master Lee, two Chinese brothers working in a research lab at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) started their own company in Beijing. Their mission: to develop computer chips tailored for AI applications, allowing smaller and more power-efficient machines, at a lower price.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633599\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633599\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633599\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/processor-2217771_1920-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633599\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Pixabay</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Raised in East China’s Jiangxi province by an educator mother and electric engineer father, Chen Yunji, 36, and Chen Tianshi, 34, have similar backgrounds. Both entered college at an early age when they were 14 and 16 years old, respectively, and obtained their doctorate degrees in computer science by the time they were 24 before joining CAS’ computing technology institute as assistant researchers, according to a profile by Elecfans.com, an electronics industry portal.</p>\\n<p>Cambricon declined an interview for this story.</p>\\n<p>While most consumers may not have heard of their company, the three-year-old Cambricon Technologies’ AI chips are everywhere now. According to CAS, Cambricon’s chips have been used to power nearly 100 million smartphones and servers so far including those by Huawei Technologies and Alibaba Group, which is the parent company of the <em>South China Morning Post</em>.</p>\\n<p>Cambricon was valued at US$2.5 billion in June 2018, according to a company statement, making it one of China’s most valuable AI startups after it raised hundreds of millions of dollars in a series B funding round.</p>\\n<p>Its long list of big-name investors include Alibaba and voice intelligence specialist iFlyTek, two of the four companies named by the Chinese government in 2017 as the country’s AI partners in an ambitious strategy to accelerate the country towards global technology leadership.</p>\\n<p>CAS, the cradle of China’s leading scientists, nominated Cambricon’s researchers for the Outstanding Science and Technology Achievement Awards 2019 last Friday for the company’s Cambricon A1 processor, which the academy said was the world’s first commercial deep learning processor.</p>\\n<p>Deep learning is a type of machine learning capable of adapting itself to new data and training its systems to learn on their own and recognize patterns. Its applications range from spotting diseases in medical images to teaching self-driving cars to stay on the road.</p>\\n<p>The processor significantly outperforms traditional CPU and GPUs, according to a document posted on CAS’ official website.</p>\\n<p>Chen Yunji has compared traditional general-purpose processors to Swiss Army knives and deep-learning processors to kitchen knives.</p>\\n<p>“The Swiss Army knife has many applications, but when cooking, a kitchen knife is still more handy,” he said in a 2017 interview with <em>AI Xingqiu</em>, an industry news portal. “Cambricon is like a good kitchen knife.”</p>\\n<p>The past few years have seen an increasing number of Chinese companies jump in the market to create the “kitchen knife” for AI, especially since Beijing announced its 2017 plan to make the country a world leader in the technology by 2030.</p>\\n<p>Recent tensions between the US and China, with the Trump administration cutting chip supplies to many Chinese tech companies, have also fuelled China’s determination to be independent in AI chip production.</p>\\n<p>But when Chen Tianshi, Cambricon’s chief executive, started to focus his research on AI chips about 10 years ago as an assistant researcher at the computing technology institute of the CAS, it was a choice that was “out of the mainstream,” the low-profile Chen told <em>China Science Daily</em> in January in one of the very few interviews he has given.</p>\\n<p>“AI itself was not a buzzword at the time, let alone producing chips that are dedicated for AI use,” he was quoted as saying in the story.</p>\\n<p>A lot has changed since then in China. No longer a niche area of research, AI chips have been developed by industry titans such as search giant Baidu, ecommerce behemoth Alibaba, and Cambricon client Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment supplier.</p>\\n<p>On the increasingly competitive AI chip landscape, Chen Tianshi told tech blog Jazzyear in 2018 that professional chip companies such as Cambricon have an edge over tech conglomerates because they tend to provide a more comprehensive suite of products that can power a range of applications.</p>\\n<p>What Cambricon really wants to achieve is to become the “stepping stone” for ubiquitous AI applications in the future, he said in the January interview with <em>China Science Daily</em>.</p>\\n<p>“People don’t need to know our name, as long as we can support downstream [AI] applications, that is our contribution,” he said.</p>\\n<p><em>Visit\\xa0<a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SCMP.com</a>\\xa0for the latest China tech news.</em></p>\\n<p><em>Copyright (c) 2019.

Merchants made good money within various online marketplaces, only to be sucked into a race to the bottom.</p>\\n<p>Direct-to-consumer (D2C) companies, which make their own products and then sell and distribute them through their own digital channels, are taking back control. They’re cutting out the middlemen – the third-party aggregators and retailers – and reaching directly into your wallets.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634093\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634093\" class=\"size-full wp-image-634093\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/love-bonito-studio-collection-studio3304-1-4-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1100\" height=\"619\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634093\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Love Bonito</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>In the media world, it’s led to successful efforts by <em>The New York Times</em>, Netflix, and Disney+ to gate their content.</p>\\n<p>In ecommerce, companies like Casper, Dollar Shave Club, and Warby Parker are making a killing in the US without relying on Amazon. They’re becoming massive, with Warby Parker now worth a little over US$1.7 billion.</p>\\n<p>Southeast Asia is still catching the wave. But the region has been developing rapidly, with rising incomes, shifting consumer tastes, and maturing infrastructure all possibly culminating in a coming D2C boom.</p>\\n<h2>Slogging in the background</h2>\\n<p>To understand how we’ve gotten to this point, let’s trace the history of ecommerce in Southeast Asia.</p>\\n<p>Pioneering D2C brands in Singapore were launched in the late 2000s. Furniture store <a href=\"https://www.fortytwo.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FortyTwo</a>, for instance, was founded in 2006, while fashion firm <a href=\"https://www.lovebonito.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Love Bonito</a> has been designing its own clothes since 2010.</p>\\n<p>Ecommerce marketplaces emerged in 2009, with Tokopedia, Qoo10, and Bukalapak sprouting up in rapid succession. A game-changer was the entry of Rocket Internet’s Lazada and Zalora and the hundreds of millions of US dollars that came with them.</p>\\n<p>Following the inflow of money, D2C upstarts mushroomed as more investors and entrepreneurs opened their eyes to ecommerce’s potential. Thailand’s <a href=\"https://www.pomelofashion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pomelo Fashion</a>, Singaporean companies <a href=\"https://secretlab.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Secretlab</a> and <a href=\"https://www.castlery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Castlery</a>, as well as Indonesia’s <a href=\"https://fabelio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fabelio</a> were started between 2013 and 2014.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634091\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634091\" class=\"wp-image-634091 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2_Cropped.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Fabelio</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>For years, marketplaces hogged all the attention as they outraised one another like players in a high-stakes poker game. Shopee is a great example. A latecomer that launched in 2015, it surprised many people by <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/blitzscaling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blitzscaling</a> its way to become a leading – but highly unprofitable – contender in Southeast Asia.</p>\\n<p>The capital raising was arguably necessary, however. There’s only room for a few players in the winner-takes-all segment of ecommerce marketplaces.</p>\\n<p>D2C brands, meanwhile, went the old-fashioned route of slowly building up their businesses. They had the luxury of time.</p>\\n<p>“In the D2C space, it’s not a zero-sum game. It’s about having sustainable growth, year in, year out,” says Dione Song, who joined Love Bonito as its chief commercial officer after stints at Zalora and Sephora. The company has grown its revenue three times between 2016 and 2018, its public filings show.</p>\\n<p>“For the majority of the years, we’ve been able to hit that growth with an EBITDA-positive margin, which means minimal burn, minimal discounting as well,” Song adds.</p>\\n<p>It’s been taking calculated risks when launching physical stores in new markets, often starting pop-ups first to gauge demand and footfall before committing to a long-term lease.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634101\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634101\" class=\"size-full wp-image-634101\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/secretlab-2020-crop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634101\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Secret Lab</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>For D2C brands, profitability is important. Secretlab, which sells chairs for gamers, is perhaps the largest of such firms in Southeast Asia. The <em>Business Times</em> reports that the company has been profitable for years and is on track to hit US$73 million in sales in 2019. It’s currently worth at least US$150 million.</p>\\n<p>Indonesian furniture seller Fabelio, too, has been building its business warehouse by warehouse. “A lot of things we did were in contrast with what investors wanted,” which were asset-light, capital-efficient, and high-margin startups, says the company’s co-founder Christian Sutardi.</p>\\n<h2>No massive D2C brands in Southeast Asia?</h2>\\n<p>As Southeast Asia increases its number of tech unicorns, it’s natural to ask why a D2C company hasn’t joined the herd.</p>\\n<p>This probably has to do with the immaturity of the region’s ecommerce scene – the first marketplaces are only a decade old.</p>\\n<p>Again, looking at history as a guide, it seems ecommerce in the US and China generally followed a logical progression. First came the marketplaces, then came the support functions for those sites: payments, logistics, and software tools. The first two phases provided a fertile bed for the last stage: a blooming of D2C brands.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634114\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634114\" class=\"wp-image-634114 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-77.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"610\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634114\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Tech in Asia</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another important factor for the rise of D2C brands – which typically compete on value rather than price – is that consumer tastes grow more sophisticated as ecommerce matures.</span></p>\\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\"><tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"></td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Ecommerce maturity</strong></td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Consumer behavior</strong></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Phase 1</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Rise of marketplaces</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Suspicious, price-sensitive, willing to try</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Phase 2</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Rise of support functions</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Online shopping becomes a habit</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Phase 3</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Rise of D2C brands</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Willing to pay more for premium goods</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody></table>\\n<p>Southeast Asia may be entering phase three. And it looks to be doing so at a faster pace than the US or China as ecommerce companies in the region are absorbing lessons from those markets.</p>\\n<p>Supporting players like logistics startup Ninja Van and supply chain platform Zilingo are getting bigger in their own right, and e-wallets are now ubiquitous in many cities.</p>\\n<p>Marketplaces have not been sitting still, either. Lazada, recognizing that premium brands demand a premium shopping experience, is ramping up LazMall, a curated – as opposed to free-for-all – marketplace where shoppers are guaranteed authentic goods.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/future-lazada\">The future of Lazada</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/lazada-founders-left-ecommerce-giant-start-kind-agency\">a couple of prominent ex-Lazadians</a> have started an agency to help social media influencers set up their own ecommerce brands.</p>\\n<p>They’ve also noticed a shift in the attitudes of Southeast Asian consumers. Instead of bargain hunting all the time, customers are now splurging on products from brands they can relate to.</p>\\n<p>It’s a sign that the region is entering a “zone of affluence,” a term <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/20-unicorns-emerge-southeast-asia-2030-predicts-asia-partners-nick-nash\">coined by private equity firm Asia Partners</a> that denotes a point in an economy where “spendable income grows from 5% to 15% of total income.” In China, this coincided with the public listings of many of the country’s tech companies.</p>\\n<p>But even as the region becomes more attractive for D2C brands, the road ahead remains bumpy.</p>\\n<p>In contrast to Southeast Asia’s fragmentation, US brands can scale quickly and efficiently, as they cater to a homogenous, large, and high-income market with a unified infrastructure.</p>\\n<p>As such, D2C companies in Southeast Asia tend to do one of two strategies if they want to succeed:</p>\\n<h3>1. Target affluent markets</h3>\\n<p>This was an approach that Secretlab decided to take. After starting from Singapore, it branched out to Malaysia, Australia, and the US, followed by the UK, Europe, and Canada.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, furniture seller Castlery expanded to Australia after launching in Singapore.</p>\\n<p>Two-year-old sunglasses brand Rocket Eyewear is following this blueprint, too.</p>\\n<p>Created by former Uber staff En Ming Ong, the self-funded and profitable company is avoiding the growth-at-all-cost model of Ong’s previous employer. It has no plans to raise money as it expands.</p>\\n<p>While the firm’s largest market is Singapore, it’s seeing traction in the US, Australia, and Hong Kong. And although the States might be an ocean away, it has seemingly become more receptive to fashion brands from Singapore.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634095\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634095\" class=\"size-full wp-image-634095\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Clock-white-background-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634095\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Rocket Eyewear</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Call it the <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> effect – a reference to the rom-com set in the city-state. “Our tourism board is doing a kickass job of portraying Singapore as this aspirational city,” says Ong, who started the brand with his sister after their mom lost her favorite shades. He’s been upfront about Rocket Eyewear being a Singaporean startup, which might have been unthinkable in the past.</p>\\n<p>Companies targeting affluent markets have a supply chain that crosses continents. In the case of Rocket Eyewear, the glasses are made in China, shipped to Singapore for packaging and additional checks, and then sent to customers.</p>\\n<p>The economics work despite the complexity: Because they cater to affluent markets, they can price their products accordingly.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/directtoconsumer-sneaker-brand-scores-us13m-seed-funding\">Direct-to-consumer sneaker brand scores US$13m in seed funding</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Another venture, Sequoia-backed personalized cosmetics brand <a href=\"https://lovefromyours.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yours</a>, is also shaped in the same mold. Its products are made in Switzerland and shipped to Singapore, the US, and Australia.</p>\\n<p>Its strategy is not just about wallet sizes, though. Consumers in those countries demand ethically made products, which Yours commits to by avoiding animal testing and using environmentally friendly packaging.</p>\\n<p>Keeping this promise can be trying. “Finding 100% recyclable packaging was way harder than I thought […] It really delayed my production by two to three months,” says the company’s CEO and founder Navneet Kaur, another Uber alum.</p>\\n<p>Despite this, she believes that committing to the company’s values can lead to stronger customer loyalty in the long run.</p>\\n<h3>2. Target neighboring countries</h3>\\n<p>The first approach is the safer option in some ways; it’s about getting products made affordably, and then sending them to people with a propensity to buy premium items.</p>\\n<p>Other companies take a more hyperlocal approach.</p>\\n<p>For example, Fabelio’s furniture pieces are made and sold in Indonesia, and it’s seen no need to expand beyond the country yet. Fashion brand Sorabel is largely focused on the archipelago, too.</p>\\n<p>The two companies are riding on a growing base of middle-class consumers, and while Indonesia doesn’t quite stack up on a per capita income basis, these startups seem to have a clear path to profitability.</p>\\n<p>Fabelio has a 37% gross margin, which is in line with other furniture retailers including Ikea. Although it’s only raised US$9 million in funding, it’s been able to, due to that margin, fund its operations using credit. Regardless, it’s set to close a series C round before the end of the year.</p>\\n<p>Sorabel, meanwhile, is profitable in Indonesia on a contribution basis – in other words, after subtracting variable costs like manufacturing. Overall, the business is still not profitable, as it’s investing in entering new markets and expanding into non-fashion categories.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/pomelo-solving-problem-plaguing-online-shopping\">Pomelo is solving a problem that’s plaguing online shopping</a></strong></p>\\n<p>However, there are some players like Pomelo and Love Bonito that don’t fit neatly into a bucket. Pomelo claims it’s already profitable in its core market of Thailand. Singapore will follow soon, while Indonesia might take longer, the company told <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\\n<p>Love Bonito, on the other hand, has storefronts in markets as diverse as Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Hong Kong.</p>\\n<p>It’s taking this approach because it aims to offer quality clothing that suits Asian women.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-634124\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Funan-Interior-Counterjpg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"732\"></p>\\n<p>Even as D2C brands in the US speed ahead, they are facing stronger competition. Just like how Disney is looking to upend Netflix, major companies and retailers are starting their own D2C ventures – <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fmcg-ceos-10-thoughts-future-dtc-frederic-fernandez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and succeeding</a>.</p>\\n<p>A similar fate could befall fledgling D2C firms in Southeast Asia as <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ovo-corporate-innovation-model-challenge-venture-capital\">large corporations get smarter about innovation</a> and major brands such as Nike <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/nike-will-end-its-pilot-project-selling-products-on-amazon-site\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pull out of marketplaces like Amazon</a>.</p>\\n<p>In addition, the democratization of ecommerce tools is lowering the barriers to selling products online. D2C companies are not only squeezed by large enterprises but also an army of social media influencers and dropshippers.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/southeast-asias-ecommerce-titans-tugofwar-marketplaces-honest\">The untold story behind the GMVs of Southeast Asia’s ecommerce titans</a></strong></p>\\n<p>It’s no secret that acquiring customers through digital channels like Google and Facebook has been getting more expensive in Southeast Asia – a reason why many D2C companies seek retail channels in the first place.</p>\\n<p>“Creating a me-too brand is very hard in today’s world,” says Dakshita Gandhi, vice president and head of private label at Zilingo. “Going after something niche but high-growth […] and then investing in conceptualizing the brand” is the way to go, she adds.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_494919\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-494919\" class=\"size-full wp-image-494919\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TeamPhoto.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"847\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-494919\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Zilingo team / Photo credit: Zilingo</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Zilingo has been spearheading this democratization. It streamlines the entire fashion supply chain by providing software to clothing and fabric suppliers to help them manage their operations and linking them up with fashion brands seeking reliable manufacturers. Its new private-label business works directly with social media influencers and non-retail brands to churn out their own product lines in a snap.</p>\\n<p>The company is solving a major bugbear for D2C brands. Alibaba may be great for sourcing manufacturers for low-cost items, but it often receives complaints about low-quality work. On the other hand, premium brands with exacting standards and demanding customers have less margin for error.</p>\\n<p>That’s the case for Rocket Eyewear, which assembles its sunglasses by hand. One screw jammed in at the wrong angle could warp the entire piece.</p>\\n<p>“I got incredibly fortunate to be able to go straight to the top factories that don’t really advertise on Alibaba,” says co-founder Ong.</p>\\n<h2>Pre-empting copycats</h2>\\n<p>Perhaps learning from their counterparts in the US, Southeast Asia’s D2C companies have wasted no time in deepening their moats.</p>\\n<p>Love Bonito and Pomelo have built networks of retail stores that serve as fitting rooms and collection points. Because customers can try before they buy, return or refund rates have been reduced, saving the companies money.</p>\\n<p>They’re mastering the complicated dance of managing omnichannel retail – inventory needs to move between locations, and stock availability data needs to be synced across online and offline channels.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_632388\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-632388\" class=\"size-full wp-image-632388\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.06.03.Pomelo.SilomComplex.PickUp0317.jpg\" alt=\"Pomelo pickup location\" width=\"1200\" height=\"975\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-632388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Pomelo pickup location / Photo credit: Pomelo</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Love Bonito is also employing data science to boost sales and reduce wastage. While traditional retailers can take weeks to gauge demand for a product and use the data to decide how much inventory to replenish, the fashion brand hopes to size the process down to a couple of days, allowing the company to ride on a hot trend much faster and more accurately.</p>\\n<p>Some D2C businesses, meanwhile, are diversifying. Fabelio, for instance, is becoming more like a marketplace, onboarding third-party furniture makers and expanding into interior design. Pomelo, too, has been stocking inventory from other brands.</p>\\n<p>Personalization is also a big strategy. The idea is that customized products become stickier, sort of like how the Facebook News Feed works.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634096\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634096\" class=\"size-full wp-image-634096\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-75.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"955\" height=\"678\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Yours</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Yours, for example, gets customers to fill out a questionnaire and upload a selfie to help it come up with a subscription-based skincare regimen.</p>\\n<p>The product mix changes over time as a customer uploads new selfies at regular intervals. “It automatically updates to changing weather conditions and skin needs,” says founder and CEO Kaur. “You may have dark circles six months down the line due to a tough phase or a lack of sleep. But you don’t have to worry about it,” she explains.</p>\\n<p>Another startup, Thailand’s <a href=\"https://vitaboost.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vitaboost</a>, is taking a similar approach but with vitamins.</p>\\n<h2>Combining media and ecommerce</h2>\\n<p>The next strategy is also perhaps the most unexploited at the moment: the melding of media and ecommerce.</p>\\n<p>Strategy consultant Frederic Fernandez <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fmcg-ceos-10-thoughts-future-dtc-frederic-fernandez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writes</a> that when it comes to D2C brands, “organic traffic and engaged consumer communities will prevail.”</p>\\n<p>“A well-known illustration is Glossier,” he adds. “It started as a beauty blog, it built its audience, and it now reaps the benefits: stellar growth, great consumer engagement, and, looking at the endless queue to get into its Manhattan store, it has a very likely low customer acquisition cost.”</p>\\n<p>It’s probable that we’ll see some major media properties in the region head down this path.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://sg.theasianparent.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TheAsianparent</a>, a Singapore-headquartered media network for parents, is looking into creating its own D2C line of baby and maternity products. It’s even started to call itself a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/theasianparent-launch-baby-products-after-series-c2\">healthtech company</a>.</p>\\n<p>One of its notable backers is Fosun – an investor in Chinese parenting site Babytree – which had its own ecommerce operations (although it’s punted that out to Alibaba instead).</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.sociolla.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sociolla</a>, an Indonesian startup that has <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/7x-gmv-growth-1-year-indonesian-cosmetics-ecommerce-startup-sociolla\">grown a sizable community of cosmetics users</a>, has stuck to distributing products from other brands. But given that it’s looking into what’s trending within its community, it could potentially launch its own cosmetics line, though it hasn’t said if it’ll do so.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_615223\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-615223\" class=\"size-full wp-image-615223\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/December-Sociolla-Box.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1002\" height=\"667\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-615223\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Sociolla</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Moving forward, as Southeast Asia’s online shopping scene matures, more D2C companies will likely emerge and even become globally recognized brands.</p>\\n<p>Aspiring D2C entrepreneurs, however, should focus on categories that general ecommerce players can’t excel in. They should also consider what the supply chain looks like, says Raditya Pramana, the investment manager at Fabelio backer Venturra Capital.</p>\\n<p>A locally focused startup like Fabelio, for example, makes a lot of sense because Indonesia already has a strong base of furniture manufacturers. Fashion startups can also thrive for the same reasons.</p>\\n<p>And yet, Indonesia can’t compete in electronics with China, which has spawned consumer tech firms like Xiaomi and DJI.</p>\\n<p>There’s also the issue of furniture ending up in a buyer’s home in one piece – or many. Fabelio set up its own delivery network because third-party providers couldn’t supply workers that could earn buyers’ trust, enter their homes, and assemble furniture.</p>\\n<p>“You wouldn’t buy a cupboard from Tokopedia. They’d need special fulfillment capabilities to make that happen,” says Pramana.</p>',\n",

A <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/featured%20insights/Future%20of%20Organizations/What%20the%20future%20of%20work%20will%20mean%20for%20jobs%20skills%20and%20wages/MGI-Jobs-Lost-Jobs-Gained-Report-December-6-2017.ashx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">McKinsey &amp; Company report</a> predicts that machines will take over up to 30% of jobs by 2030, with 50% of today’s work tasks already “automatable.”</p>\\n<p>This means people will have to upskill and reskill to avoid being displaced, says Korean-American entrepreneur So-Young Kang.</p>\\n<p>Seeing how jobs are quickly changing, Kang founded <a href=\"https://www.gnowbe.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gnowbe</a>, a mobile-first learning startup that helps enterprises train their staff to be better at certain tasks or learn new ones.</p>\\n<p>“Gnowbe means ‘grow knowledge into being.’ Our philosophy is all about helping people apply knowledge to develop skills for future work,” she tells <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\\n<p>E-learning has taken the student and professional education sector by storm since the likes of Udemy and Coursera started offering massive open online courses (MOOCs) a decade ago. But the problem with MOOCs is that they’re mostly video-based content with long running times, requiring so much attention from users. That in turn results in low completion rates.</p>\\n<p>“You can also let the video sit. Whether you apply it or not, it doesn’t matter,” Kang points out.</p>\\n<p>Singapore-based Gnowbe addresses this by offering modules in bite-sized form that can be consumed in a few minutes – and on mobile. It’s part of a new trend for so-called “microlearning.”</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633959\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633959\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633959\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gnowbe-team.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633959\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The team / Photo credit: Gnowbe</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>In addition to the “learn” part, the app has “think,” “apply,” and “share” features, which help develop skills applied on the job and encourage learning by doing.</p>\\n<p>Explaining how it works, Kang cites the example of an employee who needs to master a new sales technique. “You’ll be asked to watch a video on the technique and at the end of it, think about the challenges you may be facing when selling. It doesn’t end there. You’ll also be asked to upload a video of yourself practicing your sales pitch for your manager or entire team to see. Then your manager or team will give you the necessary feedback.”</p>\\n<p>Kang says the whole concept is based on andragogy – the science of how adults learn. When adults practice what they’ve learned, retention increases significantly.</p>\\n<p>But can small chunks of content effectively explain complex topics? “The more complex the topic and the more bite-sized you make it, the more effective the learning is because people can digest it better,” Kang contends.</p>\\n<h2>B2B focus</h2>\\n<p>Since launching in 2016, 500 Startups-backed Gnowbe has grown to serve 130 enterprise customers in 22 countries. It has landed big names like automaker Mitsubishi and education provider Navitas.</p>\\n<p>The company’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform enables those clients to create their own microlearning programs across topics such as onboarding, product training, and sales enablement – the last example being its biggest use case. So if a company has staff across multiple geographies, using Gnowbe eliminates the need for costly face-to-face training workshops.</p>\\n<p>Navitas, for instance, saw a 30% improvement in sales staff skills while reducing the cost of training by 80% after using Gnowbe.</p>\\n<p>The startup charges between US$1 and US$9 per user each month, and it now counts 70,000 employees from across its enterprise customers as users.</p>\\n<p>Apart from the SaaS platform, Gnowbe last year launched a digital content library of microcourses that anyone can subscribe to. The library has registered 15,000 individual users so far.</p>\\n<p>“Our revenues have grown three times this year from last year, and we’ll probably grow five times next year,” claims Kang, without disclosing specifics.</p>\\n<p>On why they decided to focus on the business-to-business space, Kang says, “there’s a much stronger monetization strategy here, and companies today are investing in upskilling and reskilling their employees.”</p>\\n<p>Outside Asia, she cites the case of Amazon, which earlier this year announced plans to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/11/amazon-plans-to-spend-700-million-to-retrain-a-third-of-its-workforce-in-new-skills-wsj.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">spend US$700 million to retrain</a> a third of its workforce in the US. The move is aimed at preparing employees to take on more advanced jobs at the online retail behemoth.</p>\\n<p>“Companies nowadays really struggle to make their people more productive. Every CEO, every owner knows this. I had the same struggles, too. It’s not enough to just send my people to a face-to-face training course when we know that research shows that within a day of that course, 70% of what they learn will be forgotten,” she explains.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633958\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633958\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633958\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gnowbe-founder-so-young-kang.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"530\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633958\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Founder So-Young Kan / Photo credit: Gnowbe</p>\\n</div>\\n<h2>Crowded market</h2>\\n<p>Born and raised in New York, Kang previously worked as head of performance transformation services at McKinsey North America. She came up with the idea for Gnowbe after launching her first startup – transformation design company Awaken Group – 10 years ago. In broad terms, transformation design is a human-centered, interdisciplinary process that seeks to create desirable and sustainable changes in the behavior of individuals and organizations.</p>\\n<p>Awaken has been doing a lot of face-to-face corporate training, which Kang says is very difficult and expensive to scale. “You’d need to hire a lot more people.”</p>\\n<p>So the company began looking for a platform to help it grow but couldn’t find a good one, she recalls. “A lot of platforms are not very experiential and participatory. They’re not going to let you practice anything.”</p>\\n<p>Kang decided to build her own instead. “I literally modelled Gnowbe after a powerful face-to-face workshop we had at Awaken. I digitized that workshop,” she shares.</p>\\n<p>While she says there’s value in attending a workshop in person – it’s effective for debate and relationship building – having a platform that goes beyond knowledge sharing and lets people engage and apply lessons is the next best thing.</p>\\n<p>Gnowbe benefits from its synergy with Awaken, which is now essentially a client.</p>\\n<h2>Leaving Silicon Valley</h2>\\n<p>Kang originally founded Gnowbe in Silicon Valley, but moved it to Singapore about a year later to test its product-market fit in Asia, a mobile-first region.</p>\\n<p>The global corporate learning digital space is worth over US$200 billion annually, notes Kang, and mobile learning accounts for a huge portion of that. “With the number of mobile users now greater than that of PCs, we need to design with a learner in mind who is most likely not sitting behind a PC, but may be on the go.”</p>\\n<p>Gnowbe, though, is also web-enabled, which means it’s addressing the entire space.</p>\\n<p>That also means that the company is up against so many rivals. On the content side, it competes against MOOC giants Udemy and Coursera. On the platform side, it faces off against players like <a href=\"https://www.smartup.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SmartUp</a> and <a href=\"https://axonify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Axonify</a>.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633957\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633957\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633957\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gnowbe-app.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"747\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633957\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gnowbe’s approach to “learn, think, apply” / Photo credit: Gnowbe</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>But Gnowbe claims to have better completion and engagement rates. “The completion rate of MOOCs is between 5% and 15%. Ours is over 40%,” Kang says. In terms of active engagement, which refers to the percentage of actions that users complete on a platform, the company pegs it at over 70%. “Most of our competitors don’t track this type of applied engagement because they mostly do just videos,” she observes.</p>\\n<p>She feels Gnowbe’s biggest challenge today is getting people to understand what it does. “It takes time to raise awareness. It’s a totally different user experience. You have to try it to believe it.”</p>\\n<p>The startup hasn’t done much marketing and sales yet and has relied mostly on events, word of mouth, and partnerships for growth. But it’s in the process of raising its series A round to the tune of US$5 million to US$8 million, which it will use to invest in marketing and to further expand its client roster.</p>\\n<p>Most of Gnowbe’s customers are based in Singapore, but with its ongoing US launch, the mix is expected to change.</p>\\n<p>Reflecting on her challenges as an entrepreneur, Kang feels she constantly has to prove herself as a female tech founder. “Sometimes, people assume that I don’t know anything about technology. They don’t take me as seriously. Whereas my male counterparts are asked about their vision, I get asked more operational questions.”</p>\\n<p>“All that stuff about performance is important, but talk to me about how big this market is and why we’re going to be the next big thing because that for me is the exciting part,” she adds.</p>',\n",
