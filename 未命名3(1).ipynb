It is operated by mobility startup VCNC, a subsidiary of car-sharing app <a href=\"https://www.socar.kr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SoCar</a>, which acquired the former last year.</p>\\n<p>In October 2019, prosecutors indicted VCNC’s chief exec, Park Jae-wook, and SoCar CEO Lee Jae-woong over allegations that the van-hailing service violates the country’s passenger transport service act. The law prohibits companies from operating paid ride services with rented cars, with an exception for rental vans with 11 to 15 seats. The two, however, have not been charged or arrested.</p>\\n<p>The indictments followed a string of complaints from traditional operators saying that Tada’s service harms Korea’s taxi industry.</p>\\n<p>Lee said in a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/soventure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook post</a> that about 1.3 million users and 9,000 drivers benefit from Tada, claiming that the van-hailing app is one of the mobility companies that apply AI technology the most.</p>\\n<p>“This service is allowed by the law. The police decided that this doesn’t violate the law, and the transportation ministry has never ordered us to stop for over a year when the service ran,” he wrote.</p>\\n<p>VCNC launched Tada in October 2018. It has since gained popularity in South Korea, a market where ride-hailing majors Grab and Uber struggled to gain traction.</p>\\n<p>SoCar is one of Korea’s largest ride-sharing operators. Earlier this year, it raised <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/south-korean-carsharing-firm-nabs-44m-improve-mobility-services\">US$44 million</a> in new funding from Altos Ventures, KB Investment, Stonebridge Ventures, and SoftBank Ventures.</p>\\n<p>In addition to Tada, the company will also <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/socar-ventures-micromobility-invests-korean-ebike-sharing-startup\">venture into e-bike sharing</a> after investing an undisclosed amount in\\xa0<a href=\"https://elecle.bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Elecle</a> operator <a href=\"https://www.nine2one.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nine2One</a>.

       "   'content': '<p>Dear Readers,</p>\\n<p>How much do you know about Sea Group?</p>\\n<p>Based on my casual conversations with peers outside of tech, Sea Group isn’t as well known as other tech giants in the region (e.g. Gojek, Grab, Lazada, and Razer, among others). Of course, the Sea brand isn’t consumer-facing, so that could explain why it isn’t quite as popular as its contemporaries.</p>\\n<p>In the last five years or so, I’ve also observed that the company tends to shy away from the media spotlight. <em>Tech in Asia</em>, for instance, has only interviewed Forrest Li, Sea’s founder and group CEO twice. The first one was <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/in-conversation-with-forrest-li-founder-of-garena\">in 2009</a> and the next one was conducted a decade later in July 2019, at an off-the-record fireside chat at our <a href=\"https://sync.techinasia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SYNC Summit</a>. In fact, most of Sea’s top executives don’t talk to the media – a trait that seems to part of the company’s DNA.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-634159\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/forrest-li-sea-group.jpg\" alt=\"forrest li sea group\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\"></p>\\n<h2>Talk only when necessary</h2>\\n<p>The story behind the rise of Sea Group is pretty amazing, but it’s rarely told. So when the company does engage, the outcome – such as the one at SYNC – is usually interesting and insightful. And it was also highly appreciated by the decision-makers who attended the fireside chat.</p>\\n<p>In 2016, Sea Group was <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/garena-most-valuable-startup-in-southeast-asia\">valued at nearly US$3.8 billion</a> and was one of the most valuable tech firms in Southeast Asia at the time. Today, the company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has a market capitalization of over US$17 billion, delivering return on investment to its shareholders.</p>\\n<p>It’s particularly impressive, given that so many tech stocks have tanked this year.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-634160\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sea-Group-market-cap.png\" alt=\"Sea Group market cap\" width=\"1414\" height=\"1152\"></p>\\n<p>The ability of Garena, Sea Group’s gaming division, to generate hit games and profits is also often overlooked. But in the era of “<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/asia-partners-looks-rhinos\">rhinoceros and profitability</a>” more observers are likely to appreciate it better.</p>\\n<p>And Sea Group isn’t content to just coast along. It’s still taking risks and pushing boundaries: Shopee, its ecommerce platform, is burning massive capital to fuel growth. And that’s partly possible because Garena is generating profits – US$266 million in adjusted EBITA from <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/sea-narrows-losses-q3-shopee\">last quarter</a> alone.</p>\\n<p>Read more:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/forrest-li-garena-sea-journey\">Meet Forrest Li, Southeast Asia’s newest tech billionaire</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/hit-game-helped-singapores-latest-billionaire/feed/atom?comments=true\">How a hit game helped make Singapore’s latest billionaire</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-profitable-indepth-analysis\">Can Shopee become profitable? Here’s an in-depth analysis</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Just get shit done</h2>\\n<p>As an observer, I think Sea Group’s success is implicitly nudging founders to just keep their heads down and focus on doing great work. They only talk when the work is done or whenever it’s necessary.</p>\\n<p>I also noticed that successful founders generally act the same way. I see the kind of behavior in the founders of Carousell, Gojek, Grab, Lazada, Razer, Bukalapak, Tokopedia, and many more (you know who you are).</p>\\n<p>You can find last week’s commentary via this link – “<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/profitable-startups-list\">Suddenly, profitable startups look sexy. Here’s a list.</a>”.

Don’t get me wrong; I don’t think it’s unproductive to engage with the press. In fact, it’s often a great and relatively easy way to get your work out – as long as it’s executed well, that is. Don’t get addicted to the limelight either: Your time as a founder is better spent focused on the business.</p>',\n",

It uses natural language processing, conversational AI analytics, and machine learning to scale its services, without eliminating human interaction, the company said in a statement.</p>\\n<p>Lynk plans to further expand its reach and open a new office in Toronto this year. It currently operates in New York, Singapore, Mumbai, and Shanghai.</p>\\n<p>“With the ever-increasing specialization of knowledge, it has become incredibly challenging for both small and large firms to understand new areas of interest accurately. Costs to hire or build expertise in-house are often prohibitive,” said Alibaba Hong Kong Entrepreneurs Fund executive director Cindy Chow.</p>\\n<p>Lynk positions itself as a more flexible option for companies to have access to expert advice on any given topic at any time, Chow added. Its network of advisors includes C-level executives, retired senior managers, scientists, engineers, consultants, lawyers, accountants, and financial analysts, among others.</p>\\n<p>In the past year, Lynk claims requests for its solutions from both existing and new clients have grown threefold.</p>\\n<p>In 2017, the startup raised <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/lynk-series-a-funding\">US$4 million</a> in a series A round from the Hong Leong financial group and Wavemaker Partners, among others.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>As a sizable portion of Indonesia’s population reaches their late 20s and early 30s, they start hitting the life milestones typical during that age: establishing stable careers with higher disposable income, getting married, and purchasing their first home.</p>\\n<p>That last one has led to a boom not just in housing, but also in furniture sales. According to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/247/120/furniture-appliances/indonesia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista</a>, the market size for furniture and homewares in the country is US$2.5 billion in 2019 – up by roughly 157% from 2017.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634146\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634146\" class=\"size-large wp-image-634146\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DEKORUMA_4-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634146\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An installation at Dekoruma’s experience center / Photo credit: Dekoruma</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Local brands like Informa as well as the likes of Swedish furniture giant Ikea – which entered the country in 2014 – account for part of this growth. But as Indonesia becomes increasingly digital, startups focused on home living and furnishing have begun to crop up.</p>\\n<p>Two of the most recognized are <a href=\"https://fabelio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fabelio</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dekoruma.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dekoruma</a>, which were founded in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Fabelio has raised <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/companies/fabelio\">US$9 million</a> across three rounds of funding, while Dekoruma last raised “several million dollars” in a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/in-brief-dekoruma-interior-design-services-startup-raises-several-million-dollars\">series B round</a> late last year.</p>\\n<h2>Platform vs. direct to consumer</h2>\\n<p>While both startups are in the same business, there is one key difference: their structure.</p>\\n<p>At its core, Fabelio is a direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand, similar to US mattress maker <a href=\"https://casper.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Casper</a> or Singaporean furniture store <a href=\"https://www.castlery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Castlery</a>. The company designs, manufactures, and holds inventory of its own products, which run the gamut from cushions and lamps to mattresses and kitchen sets, and sells them online.</p>\\n<p>Dekoruma, on the other hand, is a marketplace in the vein of Tokopedia or Bukalapak, but it specializes in the home living vertical. Its platform has a product range similar to Fabelio, but it gets its supply from a host of brands including Ikea, Informa, and US premium mattress brand King Koil.</p>\\n<p>Of course, each approach has its own advantages. Dekoruma’s platform model means it can carry a wider variety of products compared to Fabelio. It offers 100,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) – more than 20 times as many as Fabelio’s 4,500 SKUs.</p>\\n<p>Because Dekoruma doesn’t manufacture and store its own products, it’s also asset-light compared to Fabelio – a model that’s perhaps more friendly to investors. This particular point was a fundraising hurdle for Fabelio in its early days, according to co-founder Christian Sutardi.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634150\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634150\" class=\"size-large wp-image-634150\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Christian-Sutardi-fabelio_4-750x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634150\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fabelio co-founder Christian Sutardi (left) / Photo credit: Fabelio</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>“A lot of things we did were in contrast to what investors wanted, which was a scalable, repeatable, capital-efficient company,” he says. “In our case, we started to carry inventory early on, thinking of showrooms and warehousing and trucks, because we looked at the customer journey.”</p>\\n<p>Both companies claim that their unit economics are “positive,” but an advantage to being a DTC brand is that Fabelio operates at a bigger profit margin. Sutardi claims the company has a 37% gross margin before operations and marketing (for comparison, Ikea’s gross margin is at 40%).</p>\\n<p>“We did a lot of things that investors didn’t like, but now, in the post-WeWork era, people are looking at gross margins,” he adds.</p>\\n<p>Dekoruma, which charges a commission from every sale, declined to disclose its exact rate or its margins. Co-founder and CEO Dimas Harry Priawan says commission “ranges from single- to double-digits,” depending on whether Dekoruma provides certain value-adds like logistics.</p>\\n<p>“Our margins are not going to be as large as a DTC brand’s even [though we’re] in the furniture business, where margins are higher compared to the likes of electronics,” Priawan says. “But our commissions are still healthy.”</p>\\n<p>However, Sutardi sees Fabelio not as a DTC brand, but as “new retail” – a term popularly used to describe startups that meld online and offline experiences. Fabelio has 23 showrooms spread across Greater Jakarta, where customers can discover products and talk to salespeople.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634149\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634149\" class=\"size-large wp-image-634149\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Dimas-Harry-Priawan-DEKORUMA_1-750x485.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"485\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dekoruma co-founder and CEO Dimas Harry Priawan / Photo credit: Dekoruma</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Over 90% of Fabelio’s offline visitors were acquired online, says Sutardi. This lets the company open many showrooms in non-prime locations around Jakarta’s suburbs – which means cheaper rent – and focus on increasing awareness through their online channels.</p>\\n<p>“It’s really a no-brainer to operate these very operationally efficient showrooms. It works just like a car showroom – there’s no cash management or stock replenishment,” he explains. “That’s why it works for us as a model.”</p>\\n<p>As for Dekoruma, a platform model means that it shares a similar space as Indonesia’s ecommerce giants – such as unicorns Tokopedia and Bukalapak – but Priawan thinks there’s enough room for those players and Dekoruma to co-exist. He cites China as an example, where Alibaba’s presence hasn’t prevented niche platforms like <a href=\"https://www.haohaozhu.cn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haohaozhu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.to8to.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">To8to</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ikongjian.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iKongJian</a> from cropping up.</p>\\n<p>“We get deeper and deeper into this industry. The softwares we build are specific to this industry, for example, and eventually [we can expand] into construction and architecture. I think this will be the key differentiation between our model versus the A-to-Z marketplaces,” he says. “It’s a different product vision.”</p>\\n<h2>Moving beyond furniture</h2>\\n<p>Despite their different approaches, both companies still have much in common, starting with their target demographic. This comprises mainly of “mature millennials” aged between 25 and 40, many of whom are newlyweds who’ve just bought their first homes.</p>\\n<p>“They are typically white-collar employees, well-educated with good disposable incomes,” says Sutardi.</p>\\n<p>This demographic tends to live in one of two places: landed houses in the suburbs of Greater Jakarta, which means a longer commute but offers more affordability, – or in compact apartments closer to the city center.</p>\\n<p>Priawan says that the growth in affordable city apartments, in particular, has been a catalyst in expanding the furniture and home living market. For a long time in Indonesia, apartments were either government-subsidized low-income housing or luxury condominiums with full facilities.</p>\\n<p>That changed sometime around 2012 to 2013, when developers began building more modestly priced apartment complexes aimed at Jakarta’s young emerging middle class.</p>\\n<p>“You’re opening up a new market where people can afford a home […] close to the city center. This has greatly shaped the home and living industry,” Priawan adds.</p>\\n<p>In turn, urban lifestyles in smaller spaces have informed product selection and development. “Feedback from customers shows that with more compact homes, they want multi-use or multifunctional furniture pieces like sofa beds, for example,” Sutardi says.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634151\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634151\" class=\"size-large wp-image-634151\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fabelio-showroom-750x387.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"387\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634151\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Fabelio showroom in Alam Sutera, a Jakarta suburb / Photo credit: Fabelio</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Having started in furniture and home living products, both Fabelio and Dekoruma have since expanded into interior design services.</p>\\n<p>Fabelio’s service, dubbed Project by Fabelio, deals with both large-scale projects like cafes or co-working spaces as well as people’s homes. The company acts as the client’s single point of contact: It has an in-house interior design team and manages external subcontractors for work like flooring or lighting installations. All furnishings, of course, are Fabelio products.</p>\\n<p>“It’s a customer acquisition tool for us,” Sutardi says of the service, where the average order value is 15% higher compared to the typical online purchase. “Our customers are first-time home buyers, so they would need to fill their entire house. People tend to have a set budget for furniture, and our goal is to grab as much of this budget as possible.”</p>\\n<p>Dekoruma’s interior design service is different in that it follows its main platform model. It works with interior design “partners” – professionals who are not employed by the company – on a per-project basis.</p>\\n<p>The platform model has also enabled Dekoruma to move into other parts of the home and living vertical. The company has ventured into housing listings through Dekohouse, a site where users can browse options in the Greater Jakarta area, while also getting consultations on mortgages and legal services from Dekoruma’s partners.</p>\\n<p>“We’re a practical business in the home and living space, so we’ve always seen ourselves to be beyond furniture,” Priawan says. “The vision has stayed the same. We’ve always wanted to create a better experience for users in owning their dream home.”</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>International cross-border money payments firm TransferWise will be “very open” to partnering with more digital wallet players – including those in Singapore – as it extends its geographical reach in Southeast Asia, its chairman Taavet Hinrikus says.</p>\\n<p>The company has already announced <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/transferwise-launches-international-transfers-asian-ewallets\">tie-ups with six digital wallets</a> in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Bangladesh earlier this year, including Gojek’s Go-Pay, Grab partner Ovo, and Ant Financial-backed GCash and Dana.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_398315\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-398315\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/transferwise-ceo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"534\" class=\"size-full wp-image-398315\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-398315\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">TransferWise CEO Taavet Hinrikus during a World Economic Forum in Tianjin, China, in 2016. Photo credit: World Economic Forum / Sikarin Thanachaiary.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>These partnerships will allow TransferWise users to transfer money to e-wallets in addition to their bank accounts. With the increasing pervasiveness of digital wallets, these and bank accounts are “pretty much the same things,” Hinrikus notes.</p>\\n<p>“We don’t really see much difference in if you’re sending money to a bank account in Australia or an e-wallet in Singapore,” he adds.</p>\\n<p>At present, the company works with eight financial institutions including France’s second-largest bank, BPCE, as well as challenger banks like <a href=\"https://monzo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monzo</a> and <a href=\"https://n26.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">N26</a>.</p>\\n<p>But while the firm’s rivals have expanded their products – fintech startup <a href=\"https://www.revolut.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Revolut</a> has a range of financial services including budgeting and savings tools, and <a href=\"https://you.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTrip</a> plans to offer travel insurance – Transferwise will remain focused on its core money transfer platform.</p>\\n<p>Last week, the company launched its money transfer service in Malaysia – its fourth Asian market to offer the two-way service, after Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Prior to this, users were allowed to remit money into Malaysia, but not the other way around. While the product is being rolled out to consumers first, Hinrikus says businesses in the country will soon be able to conduct cross-border money transfers as well.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633999\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633999\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Taavet-Hinrikus-at-TransferWise-Launch.jpg\" alt=\"Taavet Hinrikus at TransferWise Launch\" width=\"1200\" height=\"802\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633999\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633999\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Taavet Hinrikus at TransferWise Launch / Photo credit: TransferWise</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>In the near future, the firm is also looking to extend the service in a few more markets in the region, but the chairman clarified that these markets “won’t be India or China.”</p>\\n<p>TransferWise, which is valued at US$3.5 billion, has been <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/3-straight-profitable-years-transferwise-eyes-asia-expansion\">profitable for three consecutive years</a>. It handles £4 billion (US$5.2 billion) in transfers and payments every month for 6 million customers worldwide, and its real exchange rate offering (the mid-point between the buy and sell rates in global currency markets) saves users £1 billion (US$1.3 billion) a year, the company claims.</p>\\n<p>Going forward, TransferWise will also be looking at making more of its services available through an API integration, which will allow businesses to leverage the company’s transfer product to make money transfers – at TransferWise’s rates – directly through their own apps. The firm has already inked partnerships with UK-based recurring payments platform <a href=\"https://gocardless.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoCardless</a> and accounting software firm <a href=\"https://transferwise.com/gb/blog/xero-transferwise-partnership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xero</a> to apply the solution.</p>\\n<p>“There’s going to be a lot more things happening on our API platform in the future,” Hinrikus adds.</p>\\n<h2>Feeling ‘pretty good’ about competition</h2>\\n<p>Asia’s cross-border money transfers space is teeming with competition. In the span of a year, users have gone from having to pay hefty currency exchange fees on remittances and overseas spending to being able to choose among various e-wallets that offer competitive real exchange rates – from the likes of Revolut, YouTrip, and financial platform <a href=\"https://www.nium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nium</a> (previously Instarem).</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_628646\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-628646\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Taavet-and-Kristo.jpg\" alt=\"Transferwise founders Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Käärmann\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" class=\"size-full wp-image-628646\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-628646\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Transferwise founders Taavet Hinrikus (L) and Kristo Käärmann (R) / Photo credit: Transferwise</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>But given TransferWise’s relatively wide international reach – users can send money to 83 countries in over 50 currencies – the company isn’t too concerned with the competition.</p>\\n<p>“To be honest, I think the competition is still mostly banks,” Hinrikus says. “Most people go to their bank when they are thinking of making an international transfer.”</p>\\n<p>At US$60 billion in annual transaction volumes, the firm’s scale also allows it to offer more competitive rates. “Payments is a scale game. More scale […] means you can offer cheaper rates to your customers,” he says.</p>\\n<p>While its regional competitors may not match it in size, they’re growing fast. Nium, which considers Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Hong Kong as key markets, is on track to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/crossborder-payments-firm-instarem-achieves-record-growth-eyes-ipo-2022\">process US$5 billion</a> in cross-border money transfers – up from US$1 billion to US$1.5 billion in transaction volumes last year, the firm’s co-founder and CEO Prajit Nanu told <em>Tech in Asia</em> in August.</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, YouTrip has processed over 10 million transactions in Singapore to date – up from <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/travel-wallet-app-youtrip-fintech-startup\">1 million in July</a> – though it’s limited to 10 currencies. Earlier this month, the Singapore-based company expanded into Thailand (its second market) via a tie-up with Kasikornbank, and it’s aiming to sign up 400,000 users in the country within the next year.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>Dear Readers,</p>\\n<p>How much do you know about Sea Group?</p>\\n<p>Based on my casual conversations with peers outside of tech, Sea Group isn’t as well known as other tech giants in the region (e.g. Gojek, Grab, Lazada, and Razer, among others). Of course, the Sea brand isn’t consumer-facing, so that could explain why it isn’t quite as popular as its contemporaries.</p>\\n<p>In the last five years or so, I’ve also observed that the company tends to shy away from the media spotlight. <em>Tech in Asia</em>, for instance, has only interviewed Forrest Li, Sea’s founder and group CEO twice. The first one was <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/in-conversation-with-forrest-li-founder-of-garena\">in 2009</a> and the next one was conducted a decade later in July 2019, at an off-the-record fireside chat at our <a href=\"https://sync.techinasia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SYNC Summit</a>. In fact, most of Sea’s top executives don’t talk to the media – a trait that seems to part of the company’s DNA.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-634159\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/forrest-li-sea-group.jpg\" alt=\"forrest li sea group\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\"></p>\\n<h2>Talk only when necessary</h2>\\n<p>The story behind the rise of Sea Group is pretty amazing, but it’s rarely told. So when the company does engage, the outcome – such as the one at SYNC – is usually interesting and insightful. And it was also highly appreciated by the decision-makers who attended the fireside chat.</p>\\n<p>In 2016, Sea Group was <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/garena-most-valuable-startup-in-southeast-asia\">valued at nearly US$3.8 billion</a> and was one of the most valuable tech firms in Southeast Asia at the time. Today, the company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and has a market capitalization of over US$17 billion, delivering return on investment to its shareholders.</p>\\n<p>It’s particularly impressive, given that so many tech stocks have tanked this year.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-634160\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sea-Group-market-cap.png\" alt=\"Sea Group market cap\" width=\"1414\" height=\"1152\"></p>\\n<p>The ability of Garena, Sea Group’s gaming division, to generate hit games and profits is also often overlooked. But in the era of “<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/asia-partners-looks-rhinos\">rhinoceros and profitability</a>” more observers are likely to appreciate it better.</p>\\n<p>And Sea Group isn’t content to just coast along. It’s still taking risks and pushing boundaries: Shopee, its ecommerce platform, is burning massive capital to fuel growth. And that’s partly possible because Garena is generating profits – US$266 million in adjusted EBITA from <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/sea-narrows-losses-q3-shopee\">last quarter</a> alone.</p>\\n<p>Read more:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/forrest-li-garena-sea-journey\">Meet Forrest Li, Southeast Asia’s newest tech billionaire</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/hit-game-helped-singapores-latest-billionaire/feed/atom?comments=true\">How a hit game helped make Singapore’s latest billionaire</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/shopee-profitable-indepth-analysis\">Can Shopee become profitable?

They only talk when the work is done or whenever it’s necessary.</p>\\n<p>I also noticed that successful founders generally act the same way. I see the kind of behavior in the founders of Carousell, Gojek, Grab, Lazada, Razer, Bukalapak, Tokopedia, and many more (you know who you are).</p>\\n<p>You can find last week’s commentary via this link – “<a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/profitable-startups-list\">Suddenly, profitable startups look sexy.

Don’t get me wrong; I don’t think it’s unproductive to engage with the press. In fact, it’s often a great and relatively easy way to get your work out – as long as it’s executed well, that is. Don’t get addicted to the limelight either: Your time as a founder is better spent focused on the business.</p>',\n",

       "   'content': '<p>As a sizable portion of Indonesia’s population reaches their late 20s and early 30s, they start hitting the life milestones typical during that age: establishing stable careers with higher disposable income, getting married, and purchasing their first home.</p>\\n<p>That last one has led to a boom not just in housing, but also in furniture sales. According to <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/247/120/furniture-appliances/indonesia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Statista</a>, the market size for furniture and homewares in the country is US$2.5 billion in 2019 – up by roughly 157% from 2017.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634146\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634146\" class=\"size-large wp-image-634146\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/DEKORUMA_4-750x500.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634146\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An installation at Dekoruma’s experience center / Photo credit: Dekoruma</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Local brands like Informa as well as the likes of Swedish furniture giant Ikea – which entered the country in 2014 – account for part of this growth. But as Indonesia becomes increasingly digital, startups focused on home living and furnishing have begun to crop up.</p>\\n<p>Two of the most recognized are <a href=\"https://fabelio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fabelio</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dekoruma.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dekoruma</a>, which were founded in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Fabelio has raised <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/companies/fabelio\">US$9 million</a> across three rounds of funding, while Dekoruma last raised “several million dollars” in a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/in-brief-dekoruma-interior-design-services-startup-raises-several-million-dollars\">series B round</a> late last year.</p>\\n<h2>Platform vs. direct to consumer</h2>\\n<p>While both startups are in the same business, there is one key difference: their structure.</p>\\n<p>At its core, Fabelio is a direct-to-consumer (DTC) brand, similar to US mattress maker <a href=\"https://casper.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Casper</a> or Singaporean furniture store <a href=\"https://www.castlery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Castlery</a>. The company designs, manufactures, and holds inventory of its own products, which run the gamut from cushions and lamps to mattresses and kitchen sets, and sells them online.</p>\\n<p>Dekoruma, on the other hand, is a marketplace in the vein of Tokopedia or Bukalapak, but it specializes in the home living vertical. Its platform has a product range similar to Fabelio, but it gets its supply from a host of brands including Ikea, Informa, and US premium mattress brand King Koil.</p>\\n<p>Of course, each approach has its own advantages. Dekoruma’s platform model means it can carry a wider variety of products compared to Fabelio. It offers 100,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs) – more than 20 times as many as Fabelio’s 4,500 SKUs.</p>\\n<p>Because Dekoruma doesn’t manufacture and store its own products, it’s also asset-light compared to Fabelio – a model that’s perhaps more friendly to investors. This particular point was a fundraising hurdle for Fabelio in its early days, according to co-founder Christian Sutardi.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634150\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634150\" class=\"size-large wp-image-634150\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Christian-Sutardi-fabelio_4-750x500.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"500\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634150\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fabelio co-founder Christian Sutardi (left) / Photo credit: Fabelio</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>“A lot of things we did were in contrast to what investors wanted, which was a scalable, repeatable, capital-efficient company,” he says. “In our case, we started to carry inventory early on, thinking of showrooms and warehousing and trucks, because we looked at the customer journey.”</p>\\n<p>Both companies claim that their unit economics are “positive,” but an advantage to being a DTC brand is that Fabelio operates at a bigger profit margin. Sutardi claims the company has a 37% gross margin before operations and marketing (for comparison, Ikea’s gross margin is at 40%).</p>\\n<p>“We did a lot of things that investors didn’t like, but now, in the post-WeWork era, people are looking at gross margins,” he adds.</p>\\n<p>Dekoruma, which charges a commission from every sale, declined to disclose its exact rate or its margins. Co-founder and CEO Dimas Harry Priawan says commission “ranges from single- to double-digits,” depending on whether Dekoruma provides certain value-adds like logistics.</p>\\n<p>“Our margins are not going to be as large as a DTC brand’s even [though we’re] in the furniture business, where margins are higher compared to the likes of electronics,” Priawan says. “But our commissions are still healthy.”</p>\\n<p>However, Sutardi sees Fabelio not as a DTC brand, but as “new retail” – a term popularly used to describe startups that meld online and offline experiences. Fabelio has 23 showrooms spread across Greater Jakarta, where customers can discover products and talk to salespeople.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634149\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634149\" class=\"size-large wp-image-634149\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Dimas-Harry-Priawan-DEKORUMA_1-750x485.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"485\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634149\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dekoruma co-founder and CEO Dimas Harry Priawan / Photo credit: Dekoruma</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Over 90% of Fabelio’s offline visitors were acquired online, says Sutardi. This lets the company open many showrooms in non-prime locations around Jakarta’s suburbs – which means cheaper rent – and focus on increasing awareness through their online channels.</p>\\n<p>“It’s really a no-brainer to operate these very operationally efficient showrooms. It works just like a car showroom – there’s no cash management or stock replenishment,” he explains. “That’s why it works for us as a model.”</p>\\n<p>As for Dekoruma, a platform model means that it shares a similar space as Indonesia’s ecommerce giants – such as unicorns Tokopedia and Bukalapak – but Priawan thinks there’s enough room for those players and Dekoruma to co-exist. He cites China as an example, where Alibaba’s presence hasn’t prevented niche platforms like <a href=\"https://www.haohaozhu.cn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Haohaozhu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.to8to.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">To8to</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ikongjian.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">iKongJian</a> from cropping up.</p>\\n<p>“We get deeper and deeper into this industry. The softwares we build are specific to this industry, for example, and eventually [we can expand] into construction and architecture. I think this will be the key differentiation between our model versus the A-to-Z marketplaces,” he says. “It’s a different product vision.”</p>\\n<h2>Moving beyond furniture</h2>\\n<p>Despite their different approaches, both companies still have much in common, starting with their target demographic. This comprises mainly of “mature millennials” aged between 25 and 40, many of whom are newlyweds who’ve just bought their first homes.</p>\\n<p>“They are typically white-collar employees, well-educated with good disposable incomes,” says Sutardi.</p>\\n<p>This demographic tends to live in one of two places: landed houses in the suburbs of Greater Jakarta, which means a longer commute but offers more affordability, – or in compact apartments closer to the city center.</p>\\n<p>Priawan says that the growth in affordable city apartments, in particular, has been a catalyst in expanding the furniture and home living market. For a long time in Indonesia, apartments were either government-subsidized low-income housing or luxury condominiums with full facilities.</p>\\n<p>That changed sometime around 2012 to 2013, when developers began building more modestly priced apartment complexes aimed at Jakarta’s young emerging middle class.</p>\\n<p>“You’re opening up a new market where people can afford a home […] close to the city center. This has greatly shaped the home and living industry,” Priawan adds.</p>\\n<p>In turn, urban lifestyles in smaller spaces have informed product selection and development. “Feedback from customers shows that with more compact homes, they want multi-use or multifunctional furniture pieces like sofa beds, for example,” Sutardi says.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634151\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634151\" class=\"size-large wp-image-634151\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Fabelio-showroom-750x387.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"387\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634151\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Fabelio showroom in Alam Sutera, a Jakarta suburb / Photo credit: Fabelio</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Having started in furniture and home living products, both Fabelio and Dekoruma have since expanded into interior design services.</p>\\n<p>Fabelio’s service, dubbed Project by Fabelio, deals with both large-scale projects like cafes or co-working spaces as well as people’s homes. The company acts as the client’s single point of contact: It has an in-house interior design team and manages external subcontractors for work like flooring or lighting installations. All furnishings, of course, are Fabelio products.</p>\\n<p>“It’s a customer acquisition tool for us,” Sutardi says of the service, where the average order value is 15% higher compared to the typical online purchase. “Our customers are first-time home buyers, so they would need to fill their entire house. People tend to have a set budget for furniture, and our goal is to grab as much of this budget as possible.”</p>\\n<p>Dekoruma’s interior design service is different in that it follows its main platform model. It works with interior design “partners” – professionals who are not employed by the company – on a per-project basis.</p>\\n<p>The platform model has also enabled Dekoruma to move into other parts of the home and living vertical. The company has ventured into housing listings through Dekohouse, a site where users can browse options in the Greater Jakarta area, while also getting consultations on mortgages and legal services from Dekoruma’s partners.</p>\\n<p>“We’re a practical business in the home and living space, so we’ve always seen ourselves to be beyond furniture,” Priawan says. “The vision has stayed the same. We’ve always wanted to create a better experience for users in owning their dream home.”</p>',\n",

Photo credit: World Economic Forum / Sikarin Thanachaiary.</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>These partnerships will allow TransferWise users to transfer money to e-wallets in addition to their bank accounts. With the increasing pervasiveness of digital wallets, these and bank accounts are “pretty much the same things,” Hinrikus notes.</p>\\n<p>“We don’t really see much difference in if you’re sending money to a bank account in Australia or an e-wallet in Singapore,” he adds.</p>\\n<p>At present, the company works with eight financial institutions including France’s second-largest bank, BPCE, as well as challenger banks like <a href=\"https://monzo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monzo</a> and <a href=\"https://n26.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">N26</a>.</p>\\n<p>But while the firm’s rivals have expanded their products – fintech startup <a href=\"https://www.revolut.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Revolut</a> has a range of financial services including budgeting and savings tools, and <a href=\"https://you.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">YouTrip</a> plans to offer travel insurance – Transferwise will remain focused on its core money transfer platform.</p>\\n<p>Last week, the company launched its money transfer service in Malaysia – its fourth Asian market to offer the two-way service, after Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan. Prior to this, users were allowed to remit money into Malaysia, but not the other way around. While the product is being rolled out to consumers first, Hinrikus says businesses in the country will soon be able to conduct cross-border money transfers as well.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_633999\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633999\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Taavet-Hinrikus-at-TransferWise-Launch.jpg\" alt=\"Taavet Hinrikus at TransferWise Launch\" width=\"1200\" height=\"802\" class=\"size-full wp-image-633999\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-633999\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Taavet Hinrikus at TransferWise Launch / Photo credit: TransferWise</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>In the near future, the firm is also looking to extend the service in a few more markets in the region, but the chairman clarified that these markets “won’t be India or China.”</p>\\n<p>TransferWise, which is valued at US$3.5 billion, has been <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/3-straight-profitable-years-transferwise-eyes-asia-expansion\">profitable for three consecutive years</a>. It handles £4 billion (US$5.2 billion) in transfers and payments every month for 6 million customers worldwide, and its real exchange rate offering (the mid-point between the buy and sell rates in global currency markets) saves users £1 billion (US$1.3 billion) a year, the company claims.</p>\\n<p>Going forward, TransferWise will also be looking at making more of its services available through an API integration, which will allow businesses to leverage the company’s transfer product to make money transfers – at TransferWise’s rates – directly through their own apps. The firm has already inked partnerships with UK-based recurring payments platform <a href=\"https://gocardless.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoCardless</a> and accounting software firm <a href=\"https://transferwise.com/gb/blog/xero-transferwise-partnership\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xero</a> to apply the solution.</p>\\n<p>“There’s going to be a lot more things happening on our API platform in the future,” Hinrikus adds.</p>\\n<h2>Feeling ‘pretty good’ about competition</h2>\\n<p>Asia’s cross-border money transfers space is teeming with competition. In the span of a year, users have gone from having to pay hefty currency exchange fees on remittances and overseas spending to being able to choose among various e-wallets that offer competitive real exchange rates – from the likes of Revolut, YouTrip, and financial platform <a href=\"https://www.nium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nium</a> (previously Instarem).</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_628646\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-628646\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Taavet-and-Kristo.jpg\" alt=\"Transferwise founders Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Käärmann\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" class=\"size-full wp-image-628646\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-628646\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Transferwise founders Taavet Hinrikus (L) and Kristo Käärmann (R) / Photo credit: Transferwise</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>But given TransferWise’s relatively wide international reach – users can send money to 83 countries in over 50 currencies – the company isn’t too concerned with the competition.</p>\\n<p>“To be honest, I think the competition is still mostly banks,” Hinrikus says. “Most people go to their bank when they are thinking of making an international transfer.”</p>\\n<p>At US$60 billion in annual transaction volumes, the firm’s scale also allows it to offer more competitive rates. “Payments is a scale game. More scale […] means you can offer cheaper rates to your customers,” he says.</p>\\n<p>While its regional competitors may not match it in size, they’re growing fast. Nium, which considers Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and Hong Kong as key markets, is on track to <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/crossborder-payments-firm-instarem-achieves-record-growth-eyes-ipo-2022\">process US$5 billion</a> in cross-border money transfers – up from US$1 billion to US$1.5 billion in transaction volumes last year, the firm’s co-founder and CEO Prajit Nanu told <em>Tech in Asia</em> in August.</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, YouTrip has processed over 10 million transactions in Singapore to date – up from <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/travel-wallet-app-youtrip-fintech-startup\">1 million in July</a> – though it’s limited to 10 currencies. Earlier this month, the Singapore-based company expanded into Thailand (its second market) via a tie-up with Kasikornbank, and it’s aiming to sign up 400,000 users in the country within the next year.</p>',\n",

Merchants made good money within various online marketplaces, only to be sucked into a race to the bottom.</p>\\n<p>Direct-to-consumer (D2C) companies, which make their own products and then sell and distribute them through their own digital channels, are taking back control. They’re cutting out the middlemen – the third-party aggregators and retailers – and reaching directly into your wallets.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634093\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634093\" class=\"size-full wp-image-634093\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/love-bonito-studio-collection-studio3304-1-4-.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1100\" height=\"619\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634093\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Love Bonito</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>In the media world, it’s led to successful efforts by <em>The New York Times</em>, Netflix, and Disney+ to gate their content.</p>\\n<p>In ecommerce, companies like Casper, Dollar Shave Club, and Warby Parker are making a killing in the US without relying on Amazon. They’re becoming massive, with Warby Parker now worth a little over US$1.7 billion.</p>\\n<p>Southeast Asia is still catching the wave. But the region has been developing rapidly, with rising incomes, shifting consumer tastes, and maturing infrastructure all possibly culminating in a coming D2C boom.</p>\\n<h2>Slogging in the background</h2>\\n<p>To understand how we’ve gotten to this point, let’s trace the history of ecommerce in Southeast Asia.</p>\\n<p>Pioneering D2C brands in Singapore were launched in the late 2000s. Furniture store <a href=\"https://www.fortytwo.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FortyTwo</a>, for instance, was founded in 2006, while fashion firm <a href=\"https://www.lovebonito.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Love Bonito</a> has been designing its own clothes since 2010.</p>\\n<p>Ecommerce marketplaces emerged in 2009, with Tokopedia, Qoo10, and Bukalapak sprouting up in rapid succession. A game-changer was the entry of Rocket Internet’s Lazada and Zalora and the hundreds of millions of US dollars that came with them.</p>\\n<p>Following the inflow of money, D2C upstarts mushroomed as more investors and entrepreneurs opened their eyes to ecommerce’s potential. Thailand’s <a href=\"https://www.pomelofashion.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pomelo Fashion</a>, Singaporean companies <a href=\"https://secretlab.sg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Secretlab</a> and <a href=\"https://www.castlery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Castlery</a>, as well as Indonesia’s <a href=\"https://fabelio.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fabelio</a> were started between 2013 and 2014.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634091\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634091\" class=\"wp-image-634091 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2_Cropped.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634091\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Fabelio</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>For years, marketplaces hogged all the attention as they outraised one another like players in a high-stakes poker game. Shopee is a great example. A latecomer that launched in 2015, it surprised many people by <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/04/blitzscaling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">blitzscaling</a> its way to become a leading – but highly unprofitable – contender in Southeast Asia.</p>\\n<p>The capital raising was arguably necessary, however. There’s only room for a few players in the winner-takes-all segment of ecommerce marketplaces.</p>\\n<p>D2C brands, meanwhile, went the old-fashioned route of slowly building up their businesses. They had the luxury of time.</p>\\n<p>“In the D2C space, it’s not a zero-sum game. It’s about having sustainable growth, year in, year out,” says Dione Song, who joined Love Bonito as its chief commercial officer after stints at Zalora and Sephora. The company has grown its revenue three times between 2016 and 2018, its public filings show.</p>\\n<p>“For the majority of the years, we’ve been able to hit that growth with an EBITDA-positive margin, which means minimal burn, minimal discounting as well,” Song adds.</p>\\n<p>It’s been taking calculated risks when launching physical stores in new markets, often starting pop-ups first to gauge demand and footfall before committing to a long-term lease.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634101\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634101\" class=\"size-full wp-image-634101\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/secretlab-2020-crop.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634101\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Secret Lab</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>For D2C brands, profitability is important. Secretlab, which sells chairs for gamers, is perhaps the largest of such firms in Southeast Asia. The <em>Business Times</em> reports that the company has been profitable for years and is on track to hit US$73 million in sales in 2019. It’s currently worth at least US$150 million.</p>\\n<p>Indonesian furniture seller Fabelio, too, has been building its business warehouse by warehouse. “A lot of things we did were in contrast with what investors wanted,” which were asset-light, capital-efficient, and high-margin startups, says the company’s co-founder Christian Sutardi.</p>\\n<h2>No massive D2C brands in Southeast Asia?</h2>\\n<p>As Southeast Asia increases its number of tech unicorns, it’s natural to ask why a D2C company hasn’t joined the herd.</p>\\n<p>This probably has to do with the immaturity of the region’s ecommerce scene – the first marketplaces are only a decade old.</p>\\n<p>Again, looking at history as a guide, it seems ecommerce in the US and China generally followed a logical progression. First came the marketplaces, then came the support functions for those sites: payments, logistics, and software tools. The first two phases provided a fertile bed for the last stage: a blooming of D2C brands.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634114\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634114\" class=\"wp-image-634114 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-77.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"987\" height=\"610\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634114\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image credit: Tech in Asia</p>\\n</div>\\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another important factor for the rise of D2C brands – which typically compete on value rather than price – is that consumer tastes grow more sophisticated as ecommerce matures.</span></p>\\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\"><tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"></td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Ecommerce maturity</strong></td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Consumer behavior</strong></td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Phase 1</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Rise of marketplaces</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Suspicious, price-sensitive, willing to try</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Phase 2</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Rise of support functions</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Online shopping becomes a habit</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Phase 3</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Rise of D2C brands</td>\\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Willing to pay more for premium goods</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody></table>\\n<p>Southeast Asia may be entering phase three. And it looks to be doing so at a faster pace than the US or China as ecommerce companies in the region are absorbing lessons from those markets.</p>\\n<p>Supporting players like logistics startup Ninja Van and supply chain platform Zilingo are getting bigger in their own right, and e-wallets are now ubiquitous in many cities.</p>\\n<p>Marketplaces have not been sitting still, either. Lazada, recognizing that premium brands demand a premium shopping experience, is ramping up LazMall, a curated – as opposed to free-for-all – marketplace where shoppers are guaranteed authentic goods.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/future-lazada\">The future of Lazada</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/lazada-founders-left-ecommerce-giant-start-kind-agency\">a couple of prominent ex-Lazadians</a> have started an agency to help social media influencers set up their own ecommerce brands.</p>\\n<p>They’ve also noticed a shift in the attitudes of Southeast Asian consumers. Instead of bargain hunting all the time, customers are now splurging on products from brands they can relate to.</p>\\n<p>It’s a sign that the region is entering a “zone of affluence,” a term <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/20-unicorns-emerge-southeast-asia-2030-predicts-asia-partners-nick-nash\">coined by private equity firm Asia Partners</a> that denotes a point in an economy where “spendable income grows from 5% to 15% of total income.” In China, this coincided with the public listings of many of the country’s tech companies.</p>\\n<p>But even as the region becomes more attractive for D2C brands, the road ahead remains bumpy.</p>\\n<p>In contrast to Southeast Asia’s fragmentation, US brands can scale quickly and efficiently, as they cater to a homogenous, large, and high-income market with a unified infrastructure.</p>\\n<p>As such, D2C companies in Southeast Asia tend to do one of two strategies if they want to succeed:</p>\\n<h3>1. Target affluent markets</h3>\\n<p>This was an approach that Secretlab decided to take. After starting from Singapore, it branched out to Malaysia, Australia, and the US, followed by the UK, Europe, and Canada.</p>\\n<p>Similarly, furniture seller Castlery expanded to Australia after launching in Singapore.</p>\\n<p>Two-year-old sunglasses brand Rocket Eyewear is following this blueprint, too.</p>\\n<p>Created by former Uber staff En Ming Ong, the self-funded and profitable company is avoiding the growth-at-all-cost model of Ong’s previous employer. It has no plans to raise money as it expands.</p>\\n<p>While the firm’s largest market is Singapore, it’s seeing traction in the US, Australia, and Hong Kong. And although the States might be an ocean away, it has seemingly become more receptive to fashion brands from Singapore.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634095\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634095\" class=\"size-full wp-image-634095\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Clock-white-background-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634095\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Rocket Eyewear</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Call it the <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> effect – a reference to the rom-com set in the city-state. “Our tourism board is doing a kickass job of portraying Singapore as this aspirational city,” says Ong, who started the brand with his sister after their mom lost her favorite shades. He’s been upfront about Rocket Eyewear being a Singaporean startup, which might have been unthinkable in the past.</p>\\n<p>Companies targeting affluent markets have a supply chain that crosses continents. In the case of Rocket Eyewear, the glasses are made in China, shipped to Singapore for packaging and additional checks, and then sent to customers.</p>\\n<p>The economics work despite the complexity: Because they cater to affluent markets, they can price their products accordingly.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/directtoconsumer-sneaker-brand-scores-us13m-seed-funding\">Direct-to-consumer sneaker brand scores US$13m in seed funding</a></strong></p>\\n<p>Another venture, Sequoia-backed personalized cosmetics brand <a href=\"https://lovefromyours.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yours</a>, is also shaped in the same mold. Its products are made in Switzerland and shipped to Singapore, the US, and Australia.</p>\\n<p>Its strategy is not just about wallet sizes, though. Consumers in those countries demand ethically made products, which Yours commits to by avoiding animal testing and using environmentally friendly packaging.</p>\\n<p>Keeping this promise can be trying. “Finding 100% recyclable packaging was way harder than I thought […] It really delayed my production by two to three months,” says the company’s CEO and founder Navneet Kaur, another Uber alum.</p>\\n<p>Despite this, she believes that committing to the company’s values can lead to stronger customer loyalty in the long run.</p>\\n<h3>2. Target neighboring countries</h3>\\n<p>The first approach is the safer option in some ways; it’s about getting products made affordably, and then sending them to people with a propensity to buy premium items.</p>\\n<p>Other companies take a more hyperlocal approach.</p>\\n<p>For example, Fabelio’s furniture pieces are made and sold in Indonesia, and it’s seen no need to expand beyond the country yet. Fashion brand Sorabel is largely focused on the archipelago, too.</p>\\n<p>The two companies are riding on a growing base of middle-class consumers, and while Indonesia doesn’t quite stack up on a per capita income basis, these startups seem to have a clear path to profitability.</p>\\n<p>Fabelio has a 37% gross margin, which is in line with other furniture retailers including Ikea. Although it’s only raised US$9 million in funding, it’s been able to, due to that margin, fund its operations using credit. Regardless, it’s set to close a series C round before the end of the year.</p>\\n<p>Sorabel, meanwhile, is profitable in Indonesia on a contribution basis – in other words, after subtracting variable costs like manufacturing. Overall, the business is still not profitable, as it’s investing in entering new markets and expanding into non-fashion categories.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/pomelo-solving-problem-plaguing-online-shopping\">Pomelo is solving a problem that’s plaguing online shopping</a></strong></p>\\n<p>However, there are some players like Pomelo and Love Bonito that don’t fit neatly into a bucket. Pomelo claims it’s already profitable in its core market of Thailand. Singapore will follow soon, while Indonesia might take longer, the company told <em>Tech in Asia</em>.</p>\\n<p>Love Bonito, on the other hand, has storefronts in markets as diverse as Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Hong Kong.</p>\\n<p>It’s taking this approach because it aims to offer quality clothing that suits Asian women.</p>\\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-634124\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Funan-Interior-Counterjpg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"732\"></p>\\n<p>Even as D2C brands in the US speed ahead, they are facing stronger competition. Just like how Disney is looking to upend Netflix, major companies and retailers are starting their own D2C ventures – <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fmcg-ceos-10-thoughts-future-dtc-frederic-fernandez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">and succeeding</a>.</p>\\n<p>A similar fate could befall fledgling D2C firms in Southeast Asia as <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/ovo-corporate-innovation-model-challenge-venture-capital\">large corporations get smarter about innovation</a> and major brands such as Nike <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-13/nike-will-end-its-pilot-project-selling-products-on-amazon-site\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pull out of marketplaces like Amazon</a>.</p>\\n<p>In addition, the democratization of ecommerce tools is lowering the barriers to selling products online. D2C companies are not only squeezed by large enterprises but also an army of social media influencers and dropshippers.</p>\\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>See: <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/southeast-asias-ecommerce-titans-tugofwar-marketplaces-honest\">The untold story behind the GMVs of Southeast Asia’s ecommerce titans</a></strong></p>\\n<p>It’s no secret that acquiring customers through digital channels like Google and Facebook has been getting more expensive in Southeast Asia – a reason why many D2C companies seek retail channels in the first place.</p>\\n<p>“Creating a me-too brand is very hard in today’s world,” says Dakshita Gandhi, vice president and head of private label at Zilingo. “Going after something niche but high-growth […] and then investing in conceptualizing the brand” is the way to go, she adds.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_494919\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-494919\" class=\"size-full wp-image-494919\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TeamPhoto.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"847\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-494919\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Zilingo team / Photo credit: Zilingo</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Zilingo has been spearheading this democratization. It streamlines the entire fashion supply chain by providing software to clothing and fabric suppliers to help them manage their operations and linking them up with fashion brands seeking reliable manufacturers. Its new private-label business works directly with social media influencers and non-retail brands to churn out their own product lines in a snap.</p>\\n<p>The company is solving a major bugbear for D2C brands. Alibaba may be great for sourcing manufacturers for low-cost items, but it often receives complaints about low-quality work. On the other hand, premium brands with exacting standards and demanding customers have less margin for error.</p>\\n<p>That’s the case for Rocket Eyewear, which assembles its sunglasses by hand. One screw jammed in at the wrong angle could warp the entire piece.</p>\\n<p>“I got incredibly fortunate to be able to go straight to the top factories that don’t really advertise on Alibaba,” says co-founder Ong.</p>\\n<h2>Pre-empting copycats</h2>\\n<p>Perhaps learning from their counterparts in the US, Southeast Asia’s D2C companies have wasted no time in deepening their moats.</p>\\n<p>Love Bonito and Pomelo have built networks of retail stores that serve as fitting rooms and collection points. Because customers can try before they buy, return or refund rates have been reduced, saving the companies money.</p>\\n<p>They’re mastering the complicated dance of managing omnichannel retail – inventory needs to move between locations, and stock availability data needs to be synced across online and offline channels.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_632388\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-632388\" class=\"size-full wp-image-632388\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.06.03.Pomelo.SilomComplex.PickUp0317.jpg\" alt=\"Pomelo pickup location\" width=\"1200\" height=\"975\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-632388\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">A Pomelo pickup location / Photo credit: Pomelo</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Love Bonito is also employing data science to boost sales and reduce wastage. While traditional retailers can take weeks to gauge demand for a product and use the data to decide how much inventory to replenish, the fashion brand hopes to size the process down to a couple of days, allowing the company to ride on a hot trend much faster and more accurately.</p>\\n<p>Some D2C businesses, meanwhile, are diversifying. Fabelio, for instance, is becoming more like a marketplace, onboarding third-party furniture makers and expanding into interior design. Pomelo, too, has been stocking inventory from other brands.</p>\\n<p>Personalization is also a big strategy. The idea is that customized products become stickier, sort of like how the Facebook News Feed works.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_634096\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634096\" class=\"size-full wp-image-634096\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-75.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"955\" height=\"678\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-634096\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Yours</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Yours, for example, gets customers to fill out a questionnaire and upload a selfie to help it come up with a subscription-based skincare regimen.</p>\\n<p>The product mix changes over time as a customer uploads new selfies at regular intervals. “It automatically updates to changing weather conditions and skin needs,” says founder and CEO Kaur. “You may have dark circles six months down the line due to a tough phase or a lack of sleep. But you don’t have to worry about it,” she explains.</p>\\n<p>Another startup, Thailand’s <a href=\"https://vitaboost.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vitaboost</a>, is taking a similar approach but with vitamins.</p>\\n<h2>Combining media and ecommerce</h2>\\n<p>The next strategy is also perhaps the most unexploited at the moment: the melding of media and ecommerce.</p>\\n<p>Strategy consultant Frederic Fernandez <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fmcg-ceos-10-thoughts-future-dtc-frederic-fernandez/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">writes</a> that when it comes to D2C brands, “organic traffic and engaged consumer communities will prevail.”</p>\\n<p>“A well-known illustration is Glossier,” he adds. “It started as a beauty blog, it built its audience, and it now reaps the benefits: stellar growth, great consumer engagement, and, looking at the endless queue to get into its Manhattan store, it has a very likely low customer acquisition cost.”</p>\\n<p>It’s probable that we’ll see some major media properties in the region head down this path.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://sg.theasianparent.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TheAsianparent</a>, a Singapore-headquartered media network for parents, is looking into creating its own D2C line of baby and maternity products. It’s even started to call itself a <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/theasianparent-launch-baby-products-after-series-c2\">healthtech company</a>.</p>\\n<p>One of its notable backers is Fosun – an investor in Chinese parenting site Babytree – which had its own ecommerce operations (although it’s punted that out to Alibaba instead).</p>\\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.sociolla.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sociolla</a>, an Indonesian startup that has <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/7x-gmv-growth-1-year-indonesian-cosmetics-ecommerce-startup-sociolla\">grown a sizable community of cosmetics users</a>, has stuck to distributing products from other brands. But given that it’s looking into what’s trending within its community, it could potentially launch its own cosmetics line, though it hasn’t said if it’ll do so.</p>\\n<div id=\"attachment_615223\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\">\\n<img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-615223\" class=\"size-full wp-image-615223\" src=\"https://cdn.techinasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/December-Sociolla-Box.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1002\" height=\"667\"><p id=\"caption-attachment-615223\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photo credit: Sociolla</p>\\n</div>\\n<p>Moving forward, as Southeast Asia’s online shopping scene matures, more D2C companies will likely emerge and even become globally recognized brands.</p>\\n<p>Aspiring D2C entrepreneurs, however, should focus on categories that general ecommerce players can’t excel in. They should also consider what the supply chain looks like, says Raditya Pramana, the investment manager at Fabelio backer Venturra Capital.</p>\\n<p>A locally focused startup like Fabelio, for example, makes a lot of sense because Indonesia already has a strong base of furniture manufacturers. Fashion startups can also thrive for the same reasons.</p>\\n<p>And yet, Indonesia can’t compete in electronics with China, which has spawned consumer tech firms like Xiaomi and DJI.</p>\\n<p>There’s also the issue of furniture ending up in a buyer’s home in one piece – or many. Fabelio set up its own delivery network because third-party providers couldn’t supply workers that could earn buyers’ trust, enter their homes, and assemble furniture.</p>\\n<p>“You wouldn’t buy a cupboard from Tokopedia. They’d need special fulfillment capabilities to make that happen,” says Pramana.</p>',\n",
